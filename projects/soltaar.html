<p>
	Soltaar is a visual impairment accessible memory matching game being developed
	as a final group project in accessibility for Web Workshop at UCF. The game will 
	support users who are blind, color blind, and have blurred vision. This projects
	highlights developing around use of a screen reader without intruding on the average,
	non impaired, user's experience. 
</p>
<h3>What can Soltaar do?</h3>
<p>
	As of this date, Soltaar can perform the following functions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Play a matching game</li>
	<li>Flip cards using CSS3 3D transforms</li>
	<li>Navigatable with a screen reader</li>
	<li>Abstracts card order from users using screen reader</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why we chose to Start the Blog Reader</h3>
<p>
	As of now there are not many blind accessible games available for 
	play through browsers. We wanted to bring this experience to visually 
	impaired users. Also, because this project uses secrecy of information 
	as a primary game mechanic, this project allows us to explore many 
	methods of information abstraction in the application's markup.
</p>
<h3>Future Goals for Soltaar</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Timed Matches</li>
	<li>Information storage for cards in background images and object properties</li>
	<li>Permission based login</li>
	<li>Admin Tools</li>
	<li>Scalable Graphics with SVG</li>
	<li>Student Progress</li>
</ol>
