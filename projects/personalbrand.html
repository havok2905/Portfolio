<h3>What is my Brand?</h3>
<p>
	First and foremost, the brand I designed is meant to symbolize
	three main concepts.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Organization</li>
	<li>Reliability</li>
	<li>Modern Design</li>
</ol>
<p>
	I achieve these concepts mainly through my use of color, font, 
	and my personal logo. The blue color is meant to be reminiscent 
	of corporatism, intelligence, and create a calming sensation 
	to the user. This is meant to subliminally communicate reliability
	which is the common attribute of what I just listed. The white and 
	dark blue colors are used primarily to allow me to insert images
	and various media seamlessly into the design without much clashing
	of color. This gives me flexibility as a designer. Also, the white 
	and dark blue colors communicate a sense of cleanliness which is 
	indicative of organization. They also suggest newness due to the illusion
	of polish.

<p>
	My personal logo was designed to communicate a very near and dear 
	value that I hold. The world is ever evolving and changing around 
	us and there is always something new to learn on the horizon. To 
	stay stagnant is to retire and quit. This is why my logo is of a 
	road leading off into the horizon, symbolizing the road to the 
	next new great thing to learn.
