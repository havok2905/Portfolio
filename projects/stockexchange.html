<h3>What is the Stock Exchange?</h3>
<p>
	The Stock Exchange was a group project for Web Design Workshop 
	at the University of Central Florida. Using a professor's 
	api, we developed a responsive front-end mobile web application
	for students to use in a stock market game. Because of the 
	redundant nature of the API that was provided to use, our 
	group also used it as an exercise in object oriented 
	development, resulting in us abstracting large chunks of code.
	This resulted in a huge relief to our JavaScript Developers.
</p>
<h3>What can the Stock Exchange Currently do?</h3>
<p>
	As of this date, the Stock Exchange can perform the following functions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>View Transaction Information</li>
	<li>Send money and stock to other users</li>
	<li>Update a personal profile picture</li>
	<li>View current funds</li>
</ol>
<h3>What Were my Roles in the Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>
	I was the acting project manager throughout the duration of the
	project and PHP developer. I took part in abstracting the 
	professor's API, building customizable profiles, building 
	a database class which turned into 
	<a href="/Portfolio/work/8">
	Regulator</a>, and managed other developers taking part on the team.
