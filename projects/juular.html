<h3>What is Juular?</h3>
<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/havok2905/Juular" target="_blank">Juular: jQuery Lightbox Plugin</a>
</p>
<p>
	Juular is a jQuery lightbox plug-in that I began to develop for use in future 
	projects and to learn more about jQuery authoring. This project taught me 
	about automatically executing functions, JavaScript prototypes, and 
	jQuery as a framework.
</p>
<h3>What can Juular Currently do?</h3>
<p>
	As of this date, Juular can perform the following functions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Construct a lightbox</li>
	<li>Take lightbox content from external HTML and PHP files</li>
	<li>Allow post data to be sent to PHP files</li>
	<li>Customizable in size and style</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why I chose to Start Juular</h3>
<p>
	I chose to start building Juular out of a need to learn more 
	about jQuery and how it works as a framework. Until this 
	point I have been blindly using it with no real concept of 
	how it functioned. Learning how to chain functions, use 
	prototypes, and more will be helpful in future programming 
	endeavors.
</p>
<h3>Future Goals for Juular</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Support full responsive behavior</li>
	<li>Allow for nested lightboxes</li>
	<li>Allow for moveable lightboxes</li>
	<li>Provide default themes for ease of use</li>
</ol>
