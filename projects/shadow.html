<h3>What is the Shadow Fan Site?</h3>
<p>
	The shadow fan site project is a fan website for a project for a Graphic 
	Design course at the University of Central Florida. Using 1950's era 
	sci-fi icons, comic book art and typography, as well as fan website 
	service and structure, we were to build an unnoficial fan website.
</p>
<h3>Design Phase</h3>
<p>
	Currently, the project is just out of the design phase. I looked 
	at component layout, branding, color schemes, and textures for the final 
	design. I chose blue, red, and dark grey colors to mimic the color schemes
	used in the shadow comics. I used vector art in particiular to allow for
	intense shadowing of the character drawings and illude to comic art. The
	typography, although not suggestive of the Shadow's character, communicates
	a sense of comic aesthetic more well known to the general comic book audience.

<h3>Development Plans</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Use scalable SVG files to make a full responsive experience</li>
	<li>Use sliding transitions from one page to the next to simulate 
		reading panels in a comic book</li>
</ol>
