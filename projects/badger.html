<h3>What is Badger?</h3>
<p>
	Badger has been in two different phases of development. The first phase was a rapid 
	prototype badging portal for distributing badges through email for a small number 
	of faculty taking part in an online course. The second phase of development for
	badger aims to make an all purpose set of badging tools for development. Badger 
	is a project for the University of Central Florida and unfortunatley I can not 
	display source code.
</p>
<h3>What can Badger currently do?</h3>
<p>
	As of this date, Badger can perform the following functions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Rapid prototype can distribute badges to a user's Mozilla open badges backpack</li>
	<li>Create new Badges through a set of admin tools</li>
	<li>Pull badges from a database through a custom REST API</li>
	<li>Generate developer keys for developers using Badger API</li>
</ol>
<h3>What is the purpose of Badger</h3>
<p>
	Badger began in development due to the rising use of badging systems
	in online learning. Gamification has played a role in enriching
	online educational environments and Badger was a small step in 
	exploring this method of teaching.
</p>
