<h3>What is the Toy Site Project?</h3>
<p>
	The toy site project is a mock retro site design project for a Graphic 
	Design course at the University of Central Florida. Using 1950's era 
	toy packaging, painted signs, and typography for reference, we are
	to design and implement a website for a toy company as if we were in the 1950s.
</p>
<h3>Design Phase</h3>
<p>
	Currently, the project is just out of the design phase. I looked 
	at component layout, branding, color schemes, and textures for the final 
	design. I chose faded red, cyan, and yellow colors after examining common 
	color schemes in 1950s toy packaging. The browns are meant to reference the use
	of cardboard in the packaging material itself. I contrast this rustic feel in 
	color with italic script like font and a fluidly moving flag for my tagline.
	I make use of subtle noise textures to mimic the feel of a painted surface as 
	well as flat paper.
