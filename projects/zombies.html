<h3>What is the World War Z Site?</h3>
<p>
	The World War Z site project is a movie website for a project for a Graphic 
	Design course at the University of Central Florida. Using movie 
	screenshots, movie posters, and other related material, we were to build 
	a new website for an upcoming film. The purpose of the project was to 
	work with large imagery in websites.
</p>
<h3>Design Phase</h3>
<p>
	Currently, the project is just out of the design phase. I looked 
	at movie posters, new branding, film screen shots, and textures from 
	the related genre in making my design. I chose black and red to 
	highlight the level of violence, as well as to better display the 
	wide array of imagery used. Use of transparent text containers
	were used to better show off the background images.

<h3>Development Plans</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Use of AJAX image viewing to prevent the use of clunky lightboxes</li>
	<li>Use of custom video player for use in the trailer page</li>
</ol>
