<h3>What is Regulator?</h3>
<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/havok2905/Regulator" target="_blank">Regulator: PHP PDO Class</a>
</p>
<p>
	Regulator is a PHP class wrapper for PDO, a prepared statement
	library for PHP. This class was built to make simple database
	queries to speed up development for more simple tasks. 
</p>
<h3>What can Regulator Currently do?</h3>
<p>
	As of this date, Regulator can perform the following functions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make a database connection</li>
	<li>Perform get array methods and does exist methods</li>
	<li>Abstracts out redundant query sytax in a general query method</li>
	<li>Modularizes placeholder string creation and manipulation</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why I chose to Start Regulator</h3>
<p>
	I chose to start building Regulator in order to better understand
	prepared statements and to protect myself from SQL injections. 
	Having to dissect the syntax bit by bit forced me to memorize the 
	material.
