	<h3>Welcome To My Corner Of The Internet!</h3>
	<p>
		Hi, my name is Christopher McLean and I am both a web developer and a web designer. This means that I
		solve both programming and artisitc oriented problems as they pertain to the web. Here on my tiny 
		slice of the web, I hope to introduce you to who I am, what I do, and maybe teach you a little 
		something about the web.
	</p>
	<p>
		The University of Central Florida has been my home for the past four years and it is where I learned
		all that I know about the design and development of interactive systems. I decided to major in 
		Digital Media, with a specialization in web design. Since starting that major I have dabbled in 
		computer science, graphic design, classical art, game design, as well as history &amp; culture. 
		It was also with UCF that I got my first job in the web industry as a web developer with the campus 
		"Center for Distributed Learning". There I have been refining my skills as a programmer and web professional.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a high interest in applications that are social or involve a dynamic set of information. I find that
		dynamic and social applications offer a more rich experience and allow for users and developers to learn more about 
		themselves as well as the world around them. I also have interest in providing simple experiences for 
		developers in the form of wrappers and web plugins, having interacted with individuals with a a beginner 
		level of experience with programming. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of the web design and web development world I am a craft beer enthusiest and amateur cook. I find 
		the culinary arts to parralell Digital Media in many ways; involving a heavey focus on creativity, 
		technical execution, and logic. I also often find my self exploring Central Texas where my parents live, 
		exploring all that Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio have to offer. However above all else, I enjoy learning
		new things. I live by one simple rule, "If you are not learning, you are retiring".
