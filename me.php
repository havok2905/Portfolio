	Hi, my name is Christopher McLean and I am both a web developer and a web designer.
	The University of Central Florida has been my home for the past four years and its where I learned
	all that I know about design and development. It is also there that I decided to major in 
	Digital Media, with a specialization in web design. Since starting in the program, I have dabbled in 
	computer science, graphic design, classical art, game design, as well as history &amp; culture. 
</p>
<p>
	I first got into the world of technology through my high school robotics team, Raider Robotix, in North
	Brunswick, New Jersey. I started working as a 3D modeler to contribute to our team's animation submissions. 
	On the team, I became familiar with programming and decided to take a class on the subject which taught Java. 
	These two vastly different skill sets led me to want to bridge the gap between art and programming, leading me 
	to major in Digital Media, specializing in web design. At the end of my Junior year I got my first job in the 
	web industry as a web developer with the campus "Center for Distributed Learning". While here I build 
	web UCF course websites to be accessible to individuals with disabilities as well as develop web 
	applications for the University.
