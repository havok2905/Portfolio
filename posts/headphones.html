<h3>What was the 3D Headphone Project?</h3>
<p>
	In taking a 3D content creation course in my Junior year in
	college, I decided to flex the old Autodesk muscles that
	have been dormant for over a year. The requirement was to
	model a household object of our choice.
</p>
<h3>Organic and Mechanical Surfaces</h3>
<p>
	I chose to model my headphones in order to explore mechanical 
	as well as organic shapes in 3D objects. The foam ear pieces
	are prime examples or organic shape. This contrasts the rigid 
	plastic surfaces which are mechanical in nature. I chose to split
	the modeling process along these two different categories of 
	shape, and welded them when the time came for smoothing. This
	allowed me to focus on the organic, mechanical, and transitional
	portions of the model all separately.
