<h3>What is RoboSim?</h3>
<p>
	<a href="http://tux.cdl.ucf.edu/~ch005004/robosim/" target="_blank" class="underline">RoboSim: Try JavaScript with Robots</a>
</p>
<p>
	Robosim is an HTML5 based learn JavaScript learning toll being developed
	within the <strong>Center for Distributed Learning at the University of Central
	Florida</strong>. I approached this project 
	with the purpose of trying to figure out a way to teach programming 
	to students who were more visually inclined. The application has a 
	code editor, a stage for the robot to move, and a library of functions 
	associated with the robot.
</p>
<h3>What can RoboSim Currently do?</h3>
<p>
	As of this date, RoboSim can perform the following functions:
</p>
<div class="mx2">
	<ol>
		<li>Draw a moveable robot on a canvas stage</li>
		<li>Be controlled through custom JavaScript Functions</li>
		<li>Take in most JavaScript syntax</li>
		<li>Abstracts out HTML5 JavaScript syntax from controls to avoid confusing the user</li>
		<li>Has a fully functioning collapsible function library for reference</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<h3>Why I chose to Start RoboSim</h3>
<p>
	I chose to start RoboSim out of watching artistically inclined students
	struggle in math heavy computer science course. The issue was not that
	they could not think logically, but rather that abstract concepts 
	in mathematics are far from what they are used to. This application 
	hopes to aid in these students being able to visually see the results
	of their code as well as to possibly spark interests in game design, 
	web design, and other artistically saturated technological careers.
</p>
<h3>Future Goals for RoboSim</h3>
<div class="mx2">
	<ol>
		<li>Support the use of while loops for movement functions</li>
		<li>Support mechanical robot extensions and sensors for use in code challenges</li>
		<li>Support code submission and grading system</li>
		<li>Support student, professor, and admin portals</li>
		<li>Support challenge/level creation tool</li>
		<li>Allow for multiplayer combat</li>
	</ol>
