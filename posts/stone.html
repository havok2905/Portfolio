<h3>What is the Stone Brewing Email Blast?</h3>

</p>
<p>
	This project was intended to be an excersise in designing
	around white space and using color only for emphasis or
	for balance. I picked to use stone brewing as my company of
	choice because their style branding let me work on a
	blank slate in terms of aesthetic. The format was meant to 
	be an email blast in order to keep the scope of the project
	focused on a single unified message.
</p>
<h3>How I designed the Email Blast</h3>
<p>
	The email blast was designed around communicating one 
	message, "Vertical Epic 12.12.12 has been released". 
	I split this task up into two main objectives.
</p>
<div class="mx2">
	<ol>
		<li>Highlight the quality of the product</li>
		<li>Direct users to find the product</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<p>
	I tackled the first objective by inserting a large 
	photograph of the bottle on the right hand side of 
	the page, pointing up at the header. This forces the
	user's eye to travel from the bottle back up to the 
	header, creating an association between the product 
	and the brand. I then add a description of the product's
	taste to complete the product's branding. The second
	objective is fufilled by including a large padding around 
	a call to action button. This implies importance and insures 
	that the user's eye always lands on it while scanning the page.
</p>
<p>
	My use of color in this project was to mimic the color
	pallete of the product, and bring life to a monochromatic 
	logo. Because, the logo was not suited for web formats, I 
	designed a colorful header around it. It was designed with
	the intent to mimic the actual colors of beer. This format
	also allows for multiple color schemes to be applied to future 
	email blasts.
