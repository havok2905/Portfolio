<h3>What can my Personal Site Currently do?</h3>

</p>
<div class="mx2">
	<ol>
		<li>Display current work</li>
		<li>Promote personal brand</li>
		<li>Allow for users to comment on blog entries</li>
		<li>Allow for users to send messages to me through a form</li>

<h3>Why I chose to Start my Personal Site</h3>
<p>
	I chose to start building my personal website in order to promote myself, 
	my work, seek new clients and work opportunities, and to communicate 
	with the rest of the web community through a blog. This site also allowed me to experiment with adaptive and responsive web design, 
	with this site supporting three different views.
</p>
<h3>Future Goals for my Personal Site</h3>
<div class="mx2">
	<ol>
		<li>Build an Autoloader Class</li>
		<li>Classify Blog Functionality</li>
		<li>Classify Date Functionality</li>
		<li>Support Nested Comments in Blog</li>
	</ol>
