<h2>Welcome To My Corner Of The Internet!</h2>
<p>
	Hi, my name is Christopher McLean and I am both a web developer 
	and a web designer living in Orlando Florida. The University of 
	Central Florida has been my home for the past four years and its where 
	I learned all that I know about design and development, as well as where 
	I decided to major in Digital Media with a specialization in web design. 
	Since starting in the program, I have studied topics in computer science, 
	graphic design, art, and game design. At the end of my Junior year 
	I got my first job in the web industry as a web developer with the campus 
	"Center for Distributed Learning", where I continue to build UCF course websites 
	that are accessible to individuals with disabilities as well as develop web 
	applications for the University using JavaScript and PHP.
