<h2>Welcome To My Corner Of The Internet!</h2>
<p>
	Hi, my name is Christopher McLean and I am both a web developer and a web designer. I
	 hope to introduce you to who I am, what I do, and maybe teach you a little 
	something about the web.
</p>
<p>
	The University of Central Florida has been my home for the past four years and it is where I learned
	all that I know about the design and development of interactive systems. I decided to major in 
	Digital Media, with a specialization in web design. Since starting in the program, I have dabbled in 
	computer science, graphic design, classical art, game design, as well as history &amp; culture. 
	It was also with UCF that I got my first job in the web industry as a web developer with the campus 
	"Center for Distributed Learning" where I have been refining my skills as a programmer and a web professional.

	I first got into the world of technology through my highschool robotics team, Raider Robotix, in North
	Brunswick, New Jersey. I started working as a 3D modeler for our team's animation submisions. From there
	I became familiar with programming and desided to take a class on the subject that taught Java. 
	These two vastly different skill sets led me to want to bridge the gap between art and logic. Starting at UCF I 
	took a class that had us build Flash websites in my third semester. It took us through the process of defining
	an aesthetic, building prototype layouts, and exploring effective interactive design practices. This is when I 
	knew that I wanted to learn to develop interactive systems.

	I call myself a web developer and designer on this site, but I do not strictly work only with the web.
 	I believe that all design is rooted in the same principles and to label design based on 
	the medium will only cut off avanues of thought from your design process. I try to draw inspiration from my design
	work from art, games, interfaces, architecture, documentation, and as many different sources as I can. I always
	try to keep learning. To stop learning is to quit, and that is something I try to never do.
