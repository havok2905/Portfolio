<h2>Breakdown of Treehouse Site</h2>
<p>
	So, I recently was given an assignment for a graphic design class in which we were to structurally break down two websites. I just finished using <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">
	Treehouse</a>, the online web development school as my first example with their full screen view. If you want to view the 
	<a href="/Project4/img/treehousebreakdown.png" target="_blank">
	full breakdown, here it is for reference.
	</a> 
	To be frank, I was blown away by the structure of its layout. It seamlessly transitioned between several different layout types as you scroll through the page. All of this is done so seamlessly though, that you never notice it actually happening. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	In the two column section you have a very deceptive square two column layout. To keep this from looking to blocky however, the designers did three things. They first alternated text and media elements, they used the bottom picture to break the plane of the upper column, and they used a call to action button to transition from the text to the image of the tree.
</p>
<p>
	<img src="/Project4/img/treehouse2.png" alt="example of three collumn layout" class="shadow"/>
</p>
<p>
	The second section makes use of  three column, single row section of a text to break away from the rigid block section above. It keeps everything left aligned to match the style of the upper section, but uses three columns to prep the user for the stylistic change that is to come next.
	They begin with a stylized header to mark the start of a new section, and follow it with center aligned 3 column layout. Each column uses an image to contrast the text heavy sections above.
	This section also uses transition in content to move from user accounts of the service to cooperate partnerships in the section below. Both sections function to build credibility and add a sense of similarity in the process of a shifting layout.

<p>
	<img src="/Project4/img/treehouse3.png" alt="example of transitionary layout" class="shadow"/>
</p>
<p>
	Under the transition section, center aligned icons and text are used to form a cone like shape that points to their call to action button. This lets the user know that they have reached the end of the stream of content and assigns a sense of importance to the content they wish the user to click on.
</p>
<p>
	When it comes to design, Treehouse doesn't just talk the talk, but walks the walk in regards to web design. I hope to see more fantastic material out of them in the future.
