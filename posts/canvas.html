<h2>HTML5 Canvas Tutorial</h2>
<p>
	As a member of the UCF, Center for Distributed Learning, 
	<a href="http://www.techrangers.ucf.edu" target="_blank">Techrangers</a>, 
	I wrote a tutorial on how to build a very basic control shceme for 
	a drivable car usign JavaScript and the canvas tag in HTML5. I spoke 
	with my team lead and was given the go-ahead to include in on my blog!
	I figured that building something interactive, as opposed to the standard
	shape making tutorial, would be fun and a great introduction to the canvas tag.
	After this tutorial and a bit more research on object oriented programming, you
	should be ready to start building some simple browser based games! Happy Coding!
